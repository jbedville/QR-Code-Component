## Overview

### Screenshot

## My process

I first wrote the html. Then the focus was in order from the background, the white containter, the qr code, and then the text.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I was pretty happy with how easily I completed the html. The CSS took a bit longer but I was proud that I had the basics down pretty easily

```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I am definitely still working out whether I should use flexbox or block in different circumstances.
